# ðŸ“¦ Installation

You can install the Netra SDK using pip or Poetry:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install netra-sdk
```

```bash poetry
poetry add netra-sdk
```
</CodeGroup>

## ðŸ”§ Optional Dependencies

Netra SDK supports optional dependencies for enhanced functionality:

### LLM-Guard for Prompt Injection Protection

To use the full functionality of prompt injection scanning provided by llm-guard:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install 'netra-sdk[llm_guard]'
```

```bash poetry
poetry add netra-sdk --extras "llm_guard"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
**Note for Intel Mac users**: The `llm-guard` package has a dependency on PyTorch, which may cause installation issues on Intel Mac machines. The base SDK will install and function correctly without llm-guard, with limited prompt injection scanning capabilities. When `llm-guard` is not available, Netra will log appropriate warnings and continue to operate with fallback behavior.
</Warning>

## ðŸš€ Quick Verification

After installation, verify that Netra SDK is working correctly:

```python
from netra import Netra

# Initialize with default settings
Netra.init(app_name="Test Application")

print("âœ… Netra SDK installed and initialized successfully!")
```

## ðŸ”§ Development Installation

If you're contributing to Netra SDK or want to install from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/netra-sdk.git
cd netra-sdk

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"

# Or with Poetry
poetry install --extras "dev test"
```
