## Installation

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install netra-sdk
```

```bash poetry
poetry add netra-sdk
```
</CodeGroup>


## Getting Started Guide



Get started with Netra SDK in just a few lines of code:

```python
from netra import Netra

# Initialize with default settings
Netra.init(app_name="Your application name")

# Or with custom configuration
api_key = "Your API key"
headers = f"x-api-key={api_key}"
Netra.init(
    app_name="Your application name",
    headers=headers,
    trace_content=True,
    environment="Your Application environment"
)
```

## Optional Dependencies

Netra SDK supports optional dependencies for enhanced functionality:

### LLM-Guard for Prompt Injection Protection

To use the full functionality of prompt injection scanning provided by llm-guard:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install 'netra-sdk[llm_guard]'
```

```bash poetry
poetry add netra-sdk --extras "llm_guard"
```
</CodeGroup>


**Note for Intel Mac users**: The `llm-guard` package has a dependency on PyTorch, which may cause installation issues on Intel Mac machines. The base SDK will install and function correctly without llm-guard, with limited prompt injection scanning capabilities. When `llm-guard` is not available, Netra will log appropriate warnings and continue to operate with fallback behavior.
